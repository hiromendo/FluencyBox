        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to redefine language education and become the platform people use to become conversationally fluent. We are making language immersion affordable and convenient. The founders felt all language learning apps were not effective in enabling speaking fluency.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To do this, weâ€™ve created an interactive story based approach where beginners to advanced learners of a language can practice conversations and get the feedback required to improve. We aim to create a judgment free place where you can practice and become confident in your speaking ability.
